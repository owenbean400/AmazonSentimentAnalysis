I am kind of disappointed.': 1, \"Seems to be cheaper quality than what I was expecting, but works okay for keeping the tiles in place, but then it wasn't very expensive to purchase.\": 1, 'Very interesting game but it mixes conspiracy theories with evidence based conspiracies.': 1, 'It was kind of boring the game. You need to do many maths on your head and it lacks of twists.': 1, \"I thought it was going to be more of a challenge but, to my surprise it's not very amusing at all.\": 1, \"Nice idea, didn't work for me.
